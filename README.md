# **iam+** coding challenges

This repository contains various coding challenges for the device management team at iam+.

Your contact person should have told you which of the challenges to look at.

Please make a fork of this repository and do the challenge directly in the folder of that challenge, using a branch called `your-name`, where *your-name* is, you guessed it, your name.

For example, if my name is John Black, and I had been told do "Challenge 1" I would fork this repo on Github, then:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/MY_GITHUB_ACCOUNT/coding-challenges.git
$ cd coding-challenges/challenge-1
$ git checkout -b john-black
... work, work, work
$ git commit -am 'Did the challenge!'
$ git push
```
Then, on Github, I would create a pull request back to the master branch of this repo.

If you have any questions, contact your iam+ contact person.

Good luck!
